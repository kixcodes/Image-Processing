# Image-Processing


Welcome to my Image Processing tutorial that will take you from the basics to the more advanced features!

In computer science, digital image processing is the use of computer algorithms to perform image processing on digital images. Image processing is a method to perform some operations on an image, in order to get an enhanced image or to extract some useful information from it. It is a type of signal processing in which input is an image and output may be image or characteristics/features associated with that image. Nowadays, image processing is among rapidly growing technologies. It forms a core research area within engineering and computer science disciplines too.

## Basic Filters

#### In the Basic Filtering folder

FILTERS: 
The filtering is done by a simple sliding-window spatial filter 
that replaces the center value in the window with a new value 
(depending on the filter). The window, or kernel, is usually 
square but can be any shape.

MEAN filter: 
Takes the average (mean) of all the pixel values in the window. 

Median filter: 
Takes the median value of all the pixel values in the window. 

GAUSSIAN filter:
It represents the shape of a Gaussian bell-shaped hump. The weights are decreaseing the further away form the center of the kernel we go.

## Edge Detection

We can easily spot edges without a problem, but how do computers determine what's an edge and what's not?

#### In the Edge Detection folder

Sobel filter:
Here it will calculate the derivative in the X-axis and the Y-axis to compute a magnitude showing edges
